# Command64 v1.1.0-beta by @tbm00
# https://github.com/tbm00/Command64/

# By default, everything is disabled.
# You should configure each module to your own liking.
# ---------
# The predefined config is there to give you and idea of what  
# you can do when using this plugin with other plugins, like 
# EssentialsX, LuckPerms, MythicMobs, a crate plugin, and more.


# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
# This module gives players the ability redeem pending rewards (commands) by using `/redeemreward`.
# -- If the player has no pending rewards, they will be sent noPendingRewardMessage.
# -- Else if the the player has inventory space, the first rewardEntry's consoleCommands 
#     in the player's pending queue will be run.
# -- Else the first rewardEntry's consoleCommands that doesn't have a invCheck will be run.
# -- If there is no pending reward without a invCheck, they will be sent noInvSpaceMessage.
# ---------
# 1st) Admins/Console add rewardCommandEntries to a player's pending queue
#        by using `/cmd reward <rewardName> <username>`.
# 2nd) Players redeem rewards (in-order, unless there are skips due to full invs) by using `/redeemreward`.
# ---------
# Currently, there is no database saving players' pending reward queues.
# So, pending rewards do not persist after restarting/reloading the server/plugin!
# ---------
# <player> == player who joined
